Intall the NS-SFR GUI software by using the installation file, found in '01 NS-SFR GUI'. There are two versions, one for Windows OS and the other is for MacOS. After following the prompted intallation steps, to open the prototype software double click on the NSSFR_GUI file, found in the directory you saved the intallation in. 

To run the MATLAB code, bring folders '02 NS-SFR MATLAB Code', '03 Manual ROI Selection' and '04 Scene Classification' into the MATLAB directory (Set Path), as they share functions.
